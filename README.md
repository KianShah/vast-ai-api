# A clean scriptable library for Vast.ai
 
 This project is not intended to replace the open-source [vast.ai library](https://github.com/vast-ai/vast-python) but rather to complement it for those who want to have an easy-to-use API to build their own projects. 
 
 It also integrates [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes for easier data manipulation.


## Installation instructions
vast-ai-api is available on PyPi:

```
$ pip install vast-ai-api
